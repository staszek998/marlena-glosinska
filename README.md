# Marlena Głosińska | Official Artist's Website

Official website made for the front woman Marlena Głosińska

## Primary Intellection

The above website was created for further use of the front woman Marlena Głosińska. Given the opportunity of designing the final project for the end of the coding bootcamp in Coders Lab, I decided to take this advantage and develop the best Artist Website I can. Here you can see results of this undertaking.
